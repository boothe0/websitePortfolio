# Old and outdated version of my current portfolio

### Issues 
1. The typewriter effect would overflow
2. Was not mobile-first desing making it hard to change after the whole site was built.
3. Flip cards were difficult to make.

### What I did well
1. The appearance of the website was well done
2. Effects were minimal but effective
